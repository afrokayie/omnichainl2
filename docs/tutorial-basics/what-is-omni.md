# What is OmniL2?  

A high-level overview of what Abstract is and how it works.  

Abstract is a Layer 2 (L2) network built on top of Ethereum, designed to securely power consumer-facing blockchain applications at scale with low fees and fast transaction speeds.  

Built on top of the ZK Stack, Abstract is a zero-knowledge (ZK) rollup built to be a more scalable alternative to Ethereum; it achieves this scalability by executing transactions off-chain, batching them together, and verifying batches of transactions on Ethereum using ZK proofs.  

Abstract is EVM compatible, meaning it looks and feels like Ethereum, but with lower gas fees and higher transaction throughput. Most existing smart contracts built for Ethereum will work out of the box on Abstract (with some differences), meaning developers can easily port applications to Abstract with minimal changes.
