# Housekeeping  
Before diving into OmnichainL2, here’s some essential information to get you started.  


### OmnichainL2 Network 

OmnichainL2 operates on the following environments:  

- **Oasis Testnet**  
  For testing and experimenting without real-world consequences.  
- **Mainnet**  
  The live environment where actual transactions and applications operate.  


### Endpoint Node

To interact with the OmnichainL2 network, you’ll need an **Endpoint Node**. This node acts as your gateway to the network for making API calls or submitting transactions.  

- **`oln`** is the OmnichainL2 Endpoint Node binary. It exposes two interfaces:  
  - A **[command-line interface (CLI)](../../nodes/endpoint-node/oln-cli-commands.md)** for node management and utility functions.  
  - The **[JSON-RPC APIs](../../../references/json-rpc/ol2/transaction-guide.md)** for programmatic interactions.  
- Compatible with Linux and macOS.  
- The `oln` CLI provides powerful tools for managing nodes and executing network tasks.  

### Smart Contract Development 

OmnichainL2 supports various tools for developing smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps):  

- **[Omnichain Plugin for Remix](https://ide.omnichainl2.io)**  
  A browser-based compiler and IDE tailored for OmnichainL2 smart contract development.  
- **[Truffle](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle)**  
  An open-source development framework for Solidity-based projects.  
- **[Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started)**  
  A comprehensive environment for building and testing smart contracts.  
- **[Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/)**  
  A modern, fast toolchain for developing, testing, and deploying smart contracts.  
- **[Thirdweb](https://portal.thirdweb.com/)**  
  A complete framework to build, manage, and analyze your Web3 applications.  

### OmnichainL2 SDKs  

SDKs allow developers to easily interact with the OmnichainL2 network:  

- **[ol2-js](../../references/sdk/ol2-js/ol2-js.md)**  
  A JavaScript library that provides access to OmnichainL2 JSON-RPC APIs.  
- **[ol2-java](../../references/sdk/ol2-java/ol2-java.md)**  
  A Java library for seamless integration with the OmnichainL2 network.  


### OmnichainL2 Toolkits 

These tools help you explore, manage, and build on OmnichainL2:  

- **[Omniscan](https://omniscan.com/)**  
  A block and transaction explorer to track network activity.  
- **[Omnichain Wallet](https://www.omnichainwallet.io/)**  
  A browser extension wallet designed for the OmnichainL2 ecosystem.  
- **[Omnichain Contracts Wizard](https://wizard.omnichainl2.foundation/)**  
  An interactive tool to bootstrap your smart contracts and learn the basics of OmnichainL2 development.
