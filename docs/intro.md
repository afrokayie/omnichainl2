Kaia uses an optimized version of Istanbul BFT, implementing Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) with blockchain-specific modifications. The consensus process involves:

1. Election of a committee validatorusing Verifiable Random Function (VRF).
2. Block generation by the elected proposer.
3. Block verification and signing by the committee.

This enables Kaia to achieve high performance, processing 4,000 transactions per second with instant transaction finality.
